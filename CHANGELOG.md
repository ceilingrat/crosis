#### v6.0.0 [BREAKING]

The client has been reworked to handle reconnection internally. The API is drastically different but the general concepts
are the same. Please refer to updated docs for usage information.

#### v5.0.0

Client close event now emits [CloseResult](https://replit-crosis.masfrost.repl.co/modules/_src_client_.html#closeresult)

Channel closing during `channel.request` no longer throws an error. It now returns an extended @replit/protocol::`Command` that includes a [`channelClosed`](https://replit-crosis.masfrost.repl.co/interfaces/_src_channel_.requestresult.html#channelclosed)

#### v4.1.3

Added a specific error (Channel.ChannelCloseError) to assert on when checking channel closing.

#### v4.1.0

Make stack traces for `Channel.request` more usable.

#### v4.0.1

Increment listener limit for the control channel (channel 0) when requesting a channel open.

#### v4.0.0 [BREAKING-ish]

This is only a breaking change for debugging and stats collection (pings)

See https://github.com/replit/crosis/pull/15

- Debug pings are not started automatically
- You can now call `client.startPing` after you connect to maintain old behavior :)

#### v3.0.2 [BREAKING]

See https://github.com/replit/crosis/pull/12

- Reset the the handshake/connection [`timeout`](https://github.com/replit/crosis/blob/d6dedc5aab6722c557da6df03b71e4e367af305d/src/client.ts#L44) if we get a message on the socket instead of waiting for `{ containerState: READY }`
- [internal] Refactor to simplify code and fit this in easily.
